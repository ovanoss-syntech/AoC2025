# Advent of Code 2025 Workspace

This is a Python workspace for solving Advent of Code 2025 challenges.

## Project Structure
- `solutions/` - Individual solution files for each day
- `inputs/` - Input files for each day
- `utils/` - Shared utility functions
- `venv/` - Virtual environment

## Getting Started
1. The virtual environment is configured in `pyproject.toml`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -e .`
3. Solutions are organized by day (day01.py, day02.py, etc.)

## Development Guidelines
- Each solution should be a standalone module
- Use the `utils/` folder for shared helper functions
- Store input files in the `inputs/` folder with naming convention: `day01.txt`, `day02.txt`, etc.
